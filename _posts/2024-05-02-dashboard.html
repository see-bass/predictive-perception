<h2 class="section-heading">Can ChatGPT be Added to a Dashboard?</h2>

<blockquote class="blockquote">The answer is yes!</blockquote>

<p>Welcome to a peek into one of my recent adventures in the realm of data analytics and AI! I'm happy to share my experience integrating a language model (LLM) chatbot into a Power BI dashboard, a project that not only flexed my technical muscles but also added a dynamic twist to data interaction. Here's how I brought this idea to life, step by step.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Step 1: Setting Up the Foundation</h2>
<p>Every great project starts with a plan and a place to store all the magic. **<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction">Github</a> has entered the chat**. I set up a repository to keep my code organized and accessible. This step is crucial for version control and collaboration, even though this time, I was flying solo.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Step 2: Gathering the Data</h2>
<p>The backbone of any data analytics project is, unsurprisingly, the data. I wrote a Python script to fetch financial data from Yahoo Finance using the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/">yfinance</a> API. This package is incredibly useful for pulling historical financial statements and market data, and it's also straightforward to use.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Step 3: Preparing the Data</h2>
<p>With access to the raw data, my next task was to structure it for a dashboard. I used the pandas library, a linchpin in the data science community, to parse the financial statements and transform them into a format ready for deeper analysis.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Step 4: Storing the Data</h2>
<p>To keep the data organized and accessible, I opted for a local MySQL database. This involved defining schemas and ensuring the data's integrity, setting the stage for seamless retrieval.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Step 5: Linking Data to Power BI</h2>
<p>With the data neatly stored in MySQL, I connected Power BI to the database. Power BI's ability to integrate with various data sources makes it an invaluable tool in my toolbox. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Step 6: Building the Dashboard</h2>
<p>The real fun began as I crafted a dashboard to analyze the "magnificent seven" tech stocks. This illustrative dashboard compares common financial metrics for these tech giants across a four year span. I elected to make use of several different chart formats and also integrated a chart with a toggleable measure. There are numerous metrics and angles that could be considered with the financial data, and perhaps I will add to the dashboard's functionality in time.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Step 7: Enhancing with AI</h2>
<p>To take this project to the next level, I incorporated an LLM chatbot into the dashboard. After downloading a custom Power BI visual that supports LLM, I integrated this feature, enabling users to interact with the dashboard through conversational AI. This addition transformed the dashboard from a static display into an interactive experience.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Step 8: Going Live</h2>
<p>The final step was to publish the dashboard to my Power BI workspace and establish a real-time data connection with MySQL. This allows for up-to-the-minute data refreshing and ensures that the insights are as current as possible.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What I Learned</h2>
<p>This project was not just about building something functional and showcasing my abilities; it was about pulling several technologies together in meaningful ways to create something cutting-edge. The blend of traditional data analytics with burgeoning AI capabilities exemplifies the future of business intelligence.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>I hope this walkthrough inspires you to explore the potentials of integrating AI into your data projects. Remember, it's not just about the data or the technology; it's about how these tools can enhance our understanding and decision-making capabilities in the business world. Dive in, experiment, and let the data lead the way to innovation!</p>
